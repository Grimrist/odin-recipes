    <img src=mousse.jpg alt="A very tasty mousse that I stole from the internet!">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A mousse or bavarois made out of lucuma. I don't like lucuma at all but my mom loves this stuff.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar turned into syrup</li>
        <li>1 satchet of flavorless jelly</li>
        <li>300 g. of lucuma pulp (or 5 lucumas)</li>
        <li>4 spoonfuls of unwhipped cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the egg white until it turns into snow. When they've become hard, add the syrup. Mix until cold.</li>
        <li>In a cup, put the flavorless jelly, add a spurt of cold water and mix. You will get a thick paste. Apply a bit of hot water and mix until fully disolved. Add to the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Mix the lucuma with the cream and add to the egg whites. Pour everything into a wet mold. Put in the fridge.</li>
        <li>After a few hours, your mousse is ready! Eat up and think about how you were expecting Mousse instead.</li>
    </ol>
